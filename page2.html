    <h1>Araquanid Team Report</h1>
    <p class="lead">First this upcoming team report is going to go through the teambuilding process behind using Araquanid. Starting off when I build this team I was looking for some under used talent in the game.  Araquanid looks like a very weak pokemon with its highest attacking stat at base 70.  However, its ability, water bubble, makes it so that its water type moves do 2x damage.  On top of this, water bubble prevents the user from being burned.  Water bubble is a uniques ability on available for its evolution line.  Because Araqaquanid is also water type it gets 1.5x damage boost from S.T.A.B. (Same Type Attack Bonus).  What pushed it over the top for me was its base defenses.  This pokemon has great bulk with a lacking HP base stat.  In a format with dynamax doubling the HP stat meant that this pokemon was going to be able to do damage and live hits.  Its speed stat at 42 meant that it would have to be used on a Trick Room team.  This started my teambuilding process.  I started with Araquanid and Dusclops.  Dusclops is arguably the best Trick Room setter in the format currently.  Because of its base 130 defenses and being a middle evoulution it can hold the item eviolite to boost its defenses by 1.5x.  Then I want a user with the move follow me.  Follow me redirects all attacks for that turn towards that pokemon.  Making it extremly hard to stop the Trick Room from going up.  I originally choose Togekiss as Togekiss is very good with lots of bulk.  However through some testing this left me extremly vulnerable to Fake Out.  Fake Out is a priority move that moves before follow me.  Without follow me dusclops would be left vulnerable.  I then test out indeedee and it fit great.  Indeedee has enough bulk to live the hits you want to live but faint to the ones you also want for a free switch to Araquanid.  This became the core.  I then added sylveon as sylveon could work both in Trick Room and out of it.  Seeing that sylveon can work both in and out of Trick Room I decided to with a Hybrid Trick Room team. This would mean I would have my team be able to have two different modes.  I then tried testing Galarian Darminitan as its able to be a very big threat and threaten a KO if you dont KO it first.  This also meant I could lead Darminitan and Dusclops and then they have to choose to sacrifice one of their pokemon to stop Trick Room or target down Darminitan and let Trick Room go up.  Targetting Darminitan also gave me a free switch into Araqaunid. After that I need a pokemon that could help boost my speed out of Trick Room because my team is generally slow.  The best fit for this role was Inteleon. Inteleon fixes a lot of holes with this team, being able to cover Duraludon which is a major threat to every single pokemon on the team.  These were my 6 pokemon that I would end up running for a good amount of time.  After testing and pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-Wash rising in usage I need a pokemon that was both Fire type and Electric type.  There is only one pokemon in the format that fills this roll, Rotom-Heat.  Because a pokemon team can only consist of 6 pokemon max I choose to drop the least used one of all of them, sylveon.  Rotom-Heat filled the same holes that sylveon and filled up even more.</p>
